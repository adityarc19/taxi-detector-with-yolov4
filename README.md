## **Dataset prep**

I have written an extensive article on Medium on how to create your own custom dataset. Not only that, I have also explained in it how to label the dataset in YOLOv4 format. 
Check it out [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-dataset-for-yolov4-object-detection-in-5-minutes-fdc988231088)!

## **Training**

Training is done using YOLOv4 Darknet on Google Colab. The entire training process is attached [here](https://github.com/adityarc19/taxi-detector-with-yolov4/blob/master/Taxi_detector_using_yolov4.ipynb).
